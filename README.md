# **ChatGuard**

**ChatGuard** is a powerful and accessible platform that uses OCR and AI to help protect minors and individuals from online sexual harassment. By allowing users to upload screenshots of harmful conversations, the app analyzes text using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to evaluate severity, flag harmful content, and recommend appropriate actions. Users can also fill out a research-informed questionnaire to further assess the situation, and—when warranted—submit anonymized harasser profiles to a shared database for community awareness. Built with **React**, **Flask**, **Pytesseract**, and **SpaCy**, **ChatGuard** is a step toward safer online environments, offering both protection and education in critical moments.
